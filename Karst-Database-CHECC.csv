51.8309,-3.6812,"Aggy's Cave, Dan-yr-Ogof",Cave,South Wales,Yes,366m,"30,000m +",Agen Allwedd also known simply as Aggy is the longest cave system on Llangattock. The cave is a famous roost for bats which can be seen roosting in the side passages of the entrance series in the winter months. The cave system is one of the longest in the country with over 30km of passages and as such offers a number of classic caving trips.,"The Agen Allwedd entrance was first investigated on Christmas Eve 1949 by Brian Price and a couple of companions, who managed to move a boulder blocking progress. In a follow-up visit the passage was explored further but thought to close down. On the 2nd January 1950 accompanied by Harold Hicken, David Seagrove they found the way through to the main passage and explored it up to the First Boulder Choke. It was not until 1957 that the Hereford Caving Club managed to dig through this choke and enter the main complex of the cave. In late 2005 while digging in Iles Inlet in an attempt to find the elusive connection to Daren Cilau a team of explorers discovered 300m of the most beautiful passage in the system ending in the spectacularly decorated Corkscrew Chamber.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"Turkey Streamway and the Main Stream Passage should be avoided in wet weather.
The Second Boulder Choke should be treated with care as boulders have moved here in the past.","Cambrian Cave Registry entry for Agen Allwedd
