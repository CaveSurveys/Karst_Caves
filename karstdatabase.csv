Key site for Victorian caving innovation, with preserved 19th-century exploration artifacts.""","Formed by glacial meltwater erosion during the Pleistocene, Gaping Gill’s Main Chamber (120m x 30m) is the UK’s largest known void. Fell Beck sinks into the shaft, resurging at Ingleborough Cave after a 3km subterranean route. First descended in 1895 using hemp ladders by Édouard Martel; his team documented the Main Chamber’s joint-controlled morphology. Annual winch meets (since 1928) demonstrate pulley systems lowering visitors 98m to the chamber floor. BCRA surveys confirm active scalloping in Stream Passage, indicating ongoing fluvial erosion.
