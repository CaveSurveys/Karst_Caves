54.1486,-2.3769,Gaping Gill,5C,Cave,Yorkshire Dales,Ingleborough Massif,Gaping Gill,Yes,110m,15km,"The Gaping Gill system, spanning 15km with 21 entrances, is centered around the Main Chamber, home to a 100m waterfall. Key routes include Main Shaft Direct (5C), Dihedral (5B), and Rat Hole (5C). Requires 2x60m ropes, deviations, and Y-hangs. Severe flood risk during rain; avoid unless conditions are bone-dry.","Main Shaft Direct begins at the iconic open shaft (grid reference SD 75120 72690). After a 10m traverse along the right wall, clip into a deviation anchor and swing left into a narrow rift. Follow a series of ledges to a Y-hang rigged with resin-bonded anchors. The 85m free-hang descent lands on the Main Chamber floor, 20m northwest of the waterfall�s plunge pool. Use a whistle to signal �rope-free� at the base. Dihedral Route diverges 25m northeast of the Main Shaft. Enter Jib Tunnel, a low crawl leading to a 40m pitch rigged to a daylight-lit ledge. From here, descend two rebelays (8m and 10m) before a final 40m hang into the chamber. Rat Hole, accessible 40m upstream under Fell Beck, involves a 10m crawl through boulders to Rat Hole Sink. Navigate Mousehole Pitch (50m), rigged with deviations at -25m (left wall) and -35m (right flake), and traverse an exposed rift to the final 35m hang.

Hazards & Historical Context:

Flood Dynamics: The Main Chamber fills rapidly during rain, transforming into a lake that floods South-East Passage. Fell Beck�s flow rate must be monitored hourly.

Rockfall: Dihedral�s upper ledge is littered with unstable debris; avoid pendulum swings into the waterfall�s spray zone.

Exchange Trips: Coordinate with a second team to exit via Bar Pot (rig a 15m traverse line at South East Pot) or Flood Entrance.

Requires 2x60m ropes and meticulous rigging. Sump risk in the final canal; avoid during heavy rain.","Entrance (SD 74835 72535): Begin at the plastic pipe entrance, rigged from a scaffold bar. Tall cavers should install a ladder for exit assistance. First Pitch: Descend 15m into a drippy chamber, then traverse 4m above the stream to the second pitch head. Second Pitch: Climb 5m to a shelf anchor, pendulum-swing over the waterfall to land in a rift passage. Third Pitch: Shuffle along the left wall to a Y-hang, deviating at -4m (left) and -14m (right) to avoid drenching. Fourth Pitch: Choose between an imbalanced Y-hang or single anchor with a mid-pitch deviation. The final 20m drop deposits cavers in Stream Chamber, where the roar of the waterfall echoes through the vast space.

Exit Strategy & Risks:

Sump Alert: The Postbox Crawl, a low canal beyond Stream Chamber, floods catastrophically during storms. Teams must carry a weather radio and retreat at the first sign of rain.

Navigation: From Stream Chamber, scramble up Mud Pot�s left edge, crawl 30m through greasy mud, and turn left at Sand Caverns Junction for the Main Chamber. Historical flooding events in 1987 and 2015 submerged this route for weeks.

Connects to Hensler�s Master Cave. Loose rocks plague pitch heads; dry conditions essential.,"Entrance (SD 75235 72450): The metal trapdoor in a shallow shakehole marks the start. Descend four rebelays in a narrow rift, each ledge equipped with resin-bonded anchors. Niagara Pitch demands a traverse out from a precarious ledge, rigging deviations to skirt the waterfall. The 40m hang lands in the Disappointment streamway between its third and fourth pitches. Downstream, climb down boulders to the river passage and turn left into New Hensler�s Passage, a 20m crawl over jagged limestone.

Connections & Precautions:

Rockfall Zones: Niagara Pitch�s upper section is notorious for dislodging debris; teams must stand clear during ascents.

Unstable walls and non-CNCC anchors demand natural belays.,"Entrance (SD 75270 72680): The bricked shaft descends into unstable terrain. Anniversary Pitch requires feet-first rigging due to the impossibility of turning around. Navigate Nemesis Crawl, a 10m thrutch over slabs, to the Elephant�s Arse, a calcite squeeze. Vindication Pitch must be rigged from the far-left anchor to avoid a mid-pitch rub point. The 60m hang lands in Mud Hall, where a traverse along the right wall (collapsed in 2017) leads to a chain-assisted climb.

Hazards & Legacy:

Collapse Risk: The traverse ledge above Mud Hall has shifted annually since 2017; rig personal safety lines.
